## User Experience

#### First user goals
This quiz is for people that want to backpack Australia and fit in easily. They will have a better chance at that by learning the aussie slangs that I use in this quiz.
- As a first time user, I want them to quickly understand what the webpage is about. 
- It should be a easy quiz where the user dont get confused by disturbing design or pop ups.
- The countent should be easily readable and with as litle grammatical mistakes as possible.
- Smooth navigation through the quiz

#### Returning user goals
- Coming back to the quiz becauce it was fun and they need to get a refresher.
- Coming back to show their friends and family.
- If I were to add high score and different levels of difficult the user could challenge themself and their friends and family.

### Wireframes
I made wireframes to get an idea of how I wanted my website to turn out and to see how it would work out with responsivness for better user experience. I changed the look of it to make it look more like you are on the same webpage when the quiz begins.

## Design

### Color theme
I wanted the website to have the same theme through the whole process to make it more user friendly. I did that by having the same colors and background image in every step. I focused on having colors with good contrast for readability, for example blue and red. I also match the colors with the Australian flag to keep the theme of Australia. I used the colors black and white to have a nice structured layout.

The color palette was created using the [Colormind](https://colormind.io/) website.

### Typografi
Google fonts were used for the title in the home page. I choose 'Lisa Bosa' because I thought it looked playful, perfect for a quiz. I used the common Arial for titles in the rule, quiz and feedback box to make it easier to read, while it still dont look to serious. For the buttons and the rules text I used the defualt font Times New Roman. To make some contrats and have them more serious looking.

## Testing
- The website have been tested with W3C Validator, Jigsaw Validator, Js Hint, The Am I Responsive website and Google Chrome lighthouse.
- All pages have been tested for screen sizes from 320px up to 1300px.
- The websites pictures are not pixeled or stretch out on any pages.
### Code validation
#### HTML
No errors where found in the code with the W3C Validator.
#### CSS
The code made it through Jigsaws validatore with no problems.
#### JavaScript
No warning in JSHint validatore.
### Am I responsive
I looked at this [website](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive?url=https://8000-klaramartinsson-aussie-a-rpeqpg0a1z.us2.codeanyapp.com/index.html) when I was making media queries to make sure the webpage looked good on all screens.

### Accessibility
I used Google Chromes lighthouse to be sure of the accessiblity. All of the pages have a good accessibility score. More things I done for the acessibility are:
- My text colors have good contrast to the backgrounds
- Using semantic HTML
- A good overall contrast with my colors
- No disturbing background images or fonts that makes text hard to read.
- All buttons have hover effect so the user will know when they can click something.

# Fixed bugs
![Fixed bug](assets/readme-images/bug.JPG)
After the time went down to 0 it started to count negative numbers. I fixed this by making an if statement in JavaScript. So now when the timer counts down it stops at 0. 

It was possible to press the next button in the quiz so you didnt have to choose an answer. I changed that by putting a hide class on the button and remove the class by a if statement when an answer is selected. 

Once the user run out of questions the game doesn't end. So I added the showFeedback function to run if the remaining questions counter gets below 1.

# Unfixed bugs
Always when you click on the answers the score highers up or down, making it easier to cheat.
