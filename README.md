## Design
### Color theme
I wanted the website to have the same theme through the whole process to make it more user friendly. I did that by having the same colors and background image in every step. I focused on having colors with good contrast for readability, for example blue and red. I also match the colors with the Australian flag to keep the theme of Australia. I used the colors black and white to have a nice structured layout.
