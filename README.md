## Design
### Color theme
I wanted the website to have the same theme through the whole process to make it more user friendly. I did that by having the same colors and background image in every step. I focused on having colors with good contrast for readability, for example blue and red. I also match the colors with the Australian flag to keep the theme of Australia. I used the colors black and white to have a nice structured layout.

The color palette was created using the [Colormind](https://colormind.io/) website.
### Typografi
Google fonts were used for the title in the home page. I choose 'Lisa Bosa' because I thought it looked playful, perfect for a quiz. I used the common Arial for titles in the rule, quiz and feedback box to make it easier to read, while it still dont look to serious. For the buttons and the rules text I used the defualt font Times New Roman. To make some contrats and have them more serious looking. 
## Features
